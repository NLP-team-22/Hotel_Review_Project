# Hotel_Review_Project

Using 20,491 hotel reviews and their corresponding rating from Trip Advisor, we utilized machine learning and natural language processing to not only estimate the review rating, but also to quantify the key features to a beneficial and detrimental hotel experience. We employed a transformer model with the raw review text and an elastic net model with input of hotel traits and amenities in addition to the sentiment. We found that the transformer model accurately predicted review ratings, but struggled to quantify key factors, while the elastic net model offered less accurate predictions, but quantifiable hotel traits and amenities. Using the elastic net model, we observed that location, employees, and dining options are crucial to a positive hotel experience.
